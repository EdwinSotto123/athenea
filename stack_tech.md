## 🚨 The Problem
**99% of domestic violence cases involve financial abuse.**
Victims are often trapped because abusers control bank accounts, credit cards, and cash flow. They lack the means to plan an escape, and traditional banking apps are easily monitored and censored by controlling partners.

## 💡 The Solution: Athena
Athena is a **stealth AI agent** disguised as a fully functional calculator. Behind the "Math-OS" interface lies an autonomous financial vault and security planner that:

1.  **Reasoning:** Uses AI to calculate personalized "Freedom Goals" (Escape budgets) based on family size and location.
2.  **Asset Protection:** Shields funds in **sFRAX (Staked Frax)** to earn yield while keeping assets hidden from abusers.
3.  **Action:** Executes instant "Panic Withdrawals" (SOS) to trusted allies in seconds.
4.  **Immutability:** Logs evidence of abuse on-chain, creating a record that cannot be deleted by smashing the phone.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

We built Athena using a **Mobile-First** architecture designed for stealth and speed, leveraging the **ADK-TS** principles for agentic workflows.

### **1. The Brain (Agent Logic)**
* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript.
* **AI Model:** **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (via Google Generative AI SDK).
    * *Why?* Extremely low latency for real-time risk assessment and JSON-structured planning.
* **Agent Framework:** Implements **ADK-TS** pattern (Reasoning Loop -> Plan -> Action).

### **2. The Vault (Blockchain Layer)**
* **Layer 1 (L1):** **Ethereum** (Base security layer).
* **Layer 2 (L2):** **Frax** (Ecosystem for sFRAX assets).
* **Assets:** **sFRAX** (Stablecoin Yield) & **USDC**.
* **Integration:** `Ethers.js` for wallet management and transaction simulation.
* **Security:** Account Abstraction principles to manage private keys securely within the agent, abstracting gas fees from the user.

### **3. The Camouflage (Frontend)**
* **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS + Lucide React + Framer Motion.
* **Stealth Mechanism:** "Math-OS" – The app functions as a calculator until specific arithmetic triggers are input (e.g., `1999=`).

## 🧠 How we used ADK-TS Principles
Athena is not just a chatbot; it is an autonomous agent structured on the **IQAI ADK-TS** philosophy:

1.  **Perception (Input):** The agent ingests unstructured user data via chat (e.g., "I need to leave with 2 kids").
2.  **Reasoning (Plan):** Using Gemini, it decomposes the request into a structured **Freedom Plan** (Logistics, Costs, Risk Level).
3.  **Action (Execute):** The agent autonomously interacts with the blockchain layer to:
    * Swap idle assets to sFRAX.
    * Execute the "SOS Protocol" (Empty Wallet) when the panic trigger is detected.
    * Mint evidence hashes on-chain.

## 📸 Key Features (Demo)

### 1. Stealth Login (`1999=`)
The entry point is invisible. The calculator works normally (e.g., `2+2=4`) until the user inputs their secret PIN.

### 2. The Freedom Planner
Athena interviews the user to generate a dynamic financial goal based on real-world costs, transforming anxiety into a concrete plan.

### 3. The Freedom Vault (sFRAX)
Funds are not just stored; they grow using **Frax Finance's sFRAX** vault, combating inflation while remaining hidden from banking statements.

### 4. Immutable Locker
Text and audio evidence are hashed and stored on-chain, ensuring proof of abuse survives device destruction.
